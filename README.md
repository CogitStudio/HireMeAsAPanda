# Hire Me As A Panda

This test is designed for the front-end developers wanting to join Cogit Studio team. It will show us what you can do with **JavaScript**, **LESS**, **GIT**, and of course **HTML** & **CSS** markup (that has to be single A accessible).

You will find in the file `resources/data.png` a screenshot of a datatable that we want to implement with HTML and CSS. You will have to make this table accessible for people on mobile phones.

As you know, a table to read data is not the most confortable thing. So, you will have to implement a switch to have some graph with any JS library you want (ChartJS, Flot, ...). When clicking on this switch, you have to parse the table and then show the graph with the same data. You have to be able to come back to the original table.

Of course, if the user does not have any Javascript enabled on his browser, you will not show him this switch button.

## How to work on this

First, you need to log in to your Github Account, and then fork this repository. You will work on your fork, and you have to commit frequently.

Files on this repository are _ready-to-work-on_. Just ensure your local PHP server has the rights to write on the `local/` folder.

* All your markup has to be on the `index.html` file, inside the `.main` div.
* Your style needs to be in LESS. In `style.less` and  `style-mobile.less` files.
* Your javascript has to be inside the `main.js`. Don't forget the best practices to do this!
* Use of jQuery is allowed.

When the work is done, please send us the link of your repository to `jobs` _at_ `cogitstudio` _dot_ `com`.

Enjoy your test!
